React routing
TEST

The application is setup with webpack so you can't simply run by clicking the index.html file.

- In your terminal, navigate to the root "/reactvlog"
- Run "npm run build" or "npm start"
- Open your web-browser and visit - localhost:8080

I use README.md very lazily--- so...

I have included some friendly information in the index.html file...

Pardon me!
Cheers!
